    This document contains a Reference Guide to the Service Standards API's listed below: 
  
    This API provides estimated delivery standard information for ZIP Code&#8482;s with 3 or 5 digits, while taking into account non-delivery days. It covers multiple mail classes, such as Priority Mail Express&#174;, Priority Mail Express&#174; (for live animals), Priority Mail&#174;, First-Class Mail&#174; Letters, First-Class Mail&#174; Flats, First-Class Mail&#174; Cards, USPS Ground Advantage&#8482;, Bound Printed Matter, First Class Mail&#174;, Library Mail, Media Mail&#174;, Parcel Select&#174;, and Parcel Select Lightweight&#174;. To utilize this API, users need to refer to [Pub 199](https://postalpro.usps.com/pub199) for Service Type Codes.
  
    **Authentication, Authorization and Access Control**
      
      Client applications are given authorized access to protected information resources. Authorization is accomplished via the USPS&#174; Customer Onboarding Platform, where Customer Registration users may grant applications access to their protected business information. All client applications must go through this onboarding process. Any Customer Registration user wishing to share their protected business information with client application(s) may also grant authorized access.

    The OAuth2, version 3 (/v3), API is based on this authorization grant and must be used to get tokens for all V3 APIs.
    * The resulting OAuth2 access token is to be placed in the **Authorization** header, using the **Bearer** authentication scheme.
    * All version 3 APIs validate access to protected information resources and will respond with a *401* HTTP status, *Unauthorized* reason, when the client application has not been authorized to access the given information resource.

    The roles involved in payment transactions will include payment account identification.
