      summary: Create a domestic shipping label.
      description: "Generates a shipping label based upon the following:\n\n  | Element                       | Description |\n  | ----------------------------- | --------|\n  | **toAddress**                 | Destination address of the recipient. The destination ZIP Code&#8482; is used for calculating pricing. |\n  | **fromAddress**               | Address where the package is being mailed from. The origin ZIP Code&#8482; is used for calculating pricing. |\n  | **senderAddress**             | Address of the business . Can differ from the fromAddress in the case the business is using a third-party logistics provider or mailing from off-site locations. |\n  | **returnAddress**             | Address where the package should be returned to if it is deemed undeliverable or returned to sender. This address will be printed in the return address block of the label. |\n  | **packageDescription**        | Package characteristics used to price the shipment including requested mail class, weight, dimensions, and more. |\n  | **imageInfo**                 | Additional details used to determine how to generate the label image. |\n  | **customsForm**               | Additional details required when creating shipments originating from or destinating to MPOs, APOs, FPOs, or DPOs (Military, Army, Fleet, and Diplomatic Post Offices) and some Military and U.S/, Possessions, Territories, and Freely Associated States (PTFAS).|\n  \n\nThe default media type of the response has multiple parts. Setting the Accept header to either application/json or application/xml will only affect the metadata part of the multipart response.\n\n**How to use this API**\n\nThe metadata part of the multipart response representation is only in application/json format media type, as default. The application/xml media type is not supported at this time.\n\nIgnore the Content-Encoding header in the second part, the label image file. The contents of this part are not compressed.\n\nIgnore the Content-Transfer-Encoding header in the second part, the label image file. The contents of this part are always Base64 encoded.\n\nIgnore the Content-Encoding header in the third part, the receipt image file. The contents of this part are not compressed.\n\nIgnore the Content-Transfer-Encoding header in the third part, the receipt image file. The contents of this part are always Base64 encoded.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nExtract the first part of the multipart response as application/json media type.\n\nExtract the second part of the multipart response and Base64 decode it to yield the binary image file.\n\nSave the binary image file, given the Content-Type header value and the filename of this part (e.g. application/pdf, label.pdf). It is recommended that you run a virus scan on the resulting downloaded file.\n\nExtract the third part of the multipart response and Base64 decode it to yield the binary image file.\n\nSave the binary image file, given the Content-Type header value and the filename of this part (e.g. application/pdf, receipt.pdf). It is recommended that you run a virus scan on the resulting downloaded file."

      summary: Create a domestic returns shipping label.
      description: |
        Generates a returns shipping label based upon the input dimensions requested.

        | Element                        | Description |
        | ------------------------------ | -------- |
        | **toAddress**                  | Destination address of the return package. The destination ZIP Code&#8482; is used for calculating pricing. |
        | **fromAddress**                | Address where the package the recipient is returning the package from. The origin ZIP Code&#8482; is used for calculating pricing. |
        | **senderAddress**              | Address of the business . Can differ from the toAddress in the case the business is using a third-party logistics provider or mailing from off-site locations.   |
        | **returnAddress**              | Address where the package should be returned to if it is deemed undeliverable or returned to sender. This address will be printed in the return address block of the label. This would represent a secondary return address if it cannot be delivered to the toAddress.  This will avoid an undeliverable as addressed (UAA) going back to the original purchaser.   |
        | **packageDescription**         | Package characteristics used to price the shipment including requested mail class, weight, dimensions, and more. |
        | **imageInfo**                  | Additional details used to update label characteristics |
        | **customsForm**                | Additional details required when creating shipments originating from or destinating to MPOs, APOs, FPOs, or DPOs (Military, Army, Fleet, and Diplomatic Post Offices) and some Military and U.S. Possessions, Territories, and Freely Associated States (PTFAS).|


        The default media type of the response has multiple parts. Setting the Accept header to either 
        `application/json` or `application/xml` will only affect the metadata part of the multipart response.

        **How to use this API**
        
        The metadata part of the multipart response representation is only in application/json 
        format media type, as default. 

        Ignore the Content-Encoding header in the second part, the label image file. The contents of this part are not compressed.


        Ignore the Content-Transfer-Encoding header in the second part, the label image file. The contents of this part are always Base64 encoded.


        Ignore the Content-Encoding header in the third part, the receipt image file. The contents of this part are not compressed.


        Ignore the Content-Transfer-Encoding header in the third part, the receipt image file. The contents of this part are always Base64 encoded.

        **Instructions**

        Extract the first part of the multipart response as application/json media type.

        Extract the second part of the multipart response and Base64 decode it to yield the binary image file.

        Save the binary image file, given the Content-Type header value and the filename of this part (e.g. application/pdf, label.pdf). It is recommended that you run a virus scan on the resulting downloaded file.

        Extract the third part of the multipart response and Base64 decode it to yield the binary image file.
        
        Save the binary image file, given the Content-Type header value and the filename of this part (e.g. application/pdf, receipt.pdf). It is recommended that you run a virus scan on the resulting downloaded file.

        A label can be canceled if a Shipping Services File has not been created. If a Shipping Services File has been created, submit a refund request for an unused label.  A label is eligible for a refund if:
        - If the label has had a Shipping Services File created for it
        - The label is not from Click-N-Ship or PC Postage
        - Is a SCAN Form label that has had its Shipping Services File created
        
        Note:
        - If the label is canceled, a Shipping Services File will not be created.
        - If a refund request is successfully submitted, a disputeId will be returned that can be used to then track the status of the refund request. The system will only give one unique disputeId per customer reference ID (CRID) per day. Duplicate submissions of the same label, for the same CRID, on the same day, will be rejected.

      summary: Upload an SVG image to be used as a label branding image.
      description: |
        The USPS Logo Branding endpoint allows you to upload your custom image or 
        logo to USPS APIs. A UUID is generated for your custom image to 
        leverage for outbound Domestic Labels and Return Labels requests. The 
        user will indicate how their custom image or multiple images will 
        display, and the option to specify the shape of their image when 
        generating labels and return labels.

        Note:
        * It may take up to 15 minutes for the label image to propagate to all regions for label usage.
        * There is a limit of 50 images to be stored per customer reference ID (CRID). The CRID will be taken from the `LABEL_OWNER` role of your Payment Authorization token.
        * The root svg element requires either a `length` and `width` attribute, or a `viewbox` attribute
          * Recommendation: Define a 1:1 square `viewBox` in your SVG and allow the artwork inside to occupy 100% of that space. This will allow your logo to be shown at the highest resolution possible.
        * `<script/>` element tags and `DOCTYPE` definitions are not allowed. The `<use/>` and `<image/>` tags are not allowed to use the attribute `xlink:href`.

              The [internal transaction number (ITN)](https://pe.usps.com/text/imm/immc5_010.htm) is a 14-digit number that corresponds to an export transaction in the Automated Export System. It serves as proof that an exporter met his or her legal obligation to inform the U.S. government about the details of an export shipment.
            * **EEL- Exemptions, Exclusions, Legend**\
              An [AES exemption](https://pe.usps.com/text/imm/immc5_012.htm) is an instance in which you would not have to file in AES to get the 14-digit ITN. Instead of the ITN, you would enter the exemption’s section in the U.S. Foreign Trade Regulations on the export documentation where you would otherwise put the ITN.
