    Contact Us: [USPS API Support](https://emailus.usps.com/s/web-tools-inquiry) | [Terms of Service](https://about.usps.com/termsofuse.htm)
    
    This API allows users to retrieve detailed information about a specific USPS&#174; package. Using the USPS&#174; Tracking Request, individuals can view the delivery status of various mail items, such as Priority Mail&#174;, Priority Mail Express&#174;, and Package Services (including Parcel Post&#174;, Bound Printed Matter, Library Mail, and Media Mail&#174;) that have USPS&#174; Tracking. By collecting mail class and service information from Product Tracking Systems, USPS&#174; Tracking provides users with delivery status updates. By entering the tracking number, users can view the detailed delivery status of single Priority Mail&#174; and Package Service parcels with Delivery Confirmation.
    
     By registering for the USPS&#174; Tracking by Email service, users can receive email notifications about their package tracking events. This service allows customers to submit their email address to be notified of current or future tracking activity. Users can choose to receive notifications for all activity to date, all future activity, or both. Whenever a mail piece receives an email notifiable event, an email with the relevant information will be generated and sent. With the new request type, users can make multiple requests for a single mail piece in a single request. Tracking status can be obtained using just the IMpb, and if multiple items are found, users can include additional details in the request.

        - Delivery Date Updates: Receive a message when the expected delivery date or time window is available or changes. When USPS delivers, transfers, returns, or holds your package for any reason, you will no longer receive expected delivery information.
        - Delivery Activity: Receive a message when package has been delivered, delayed, or action is needed (e.g. Schedule Redelivery or Pickup) related to your package.
        - All Updates: Receive a message any time there is a new tracking update.
