    The U.S. Postal Service®️ offers services at locations other than a Post Office. The Locations API can be used to find USPS&#174; facility addresses, hours of operations, available services, locker lookup, and more. USPS&#174; has specific rules to receive destination 
    entry rates at eligible entry locations. The Locations APIs can be used to find these locations to use in the Labels API when creating shipping labels as the destination entry facility address.
